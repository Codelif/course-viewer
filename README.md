# Course Viewer
<p>Tired of switching between Video Player, Browser and what-not in an downloaded course?</p>
<p>Try <b>Course Viewer</b>, it automatically parses the files in the course and displays it in an easy to navigate and managable way. Just like Udemy, Skill Share, etc but it works on local files.</p>
